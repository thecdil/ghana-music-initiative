This Asante proverb resonates today in the voices of the people and on the skins of the atumpan.[^1] 
The transfer of discernable language onto a musical instrument or sound producing object for the purpose of encoding a message can be defined as “speech surrogacy.” 
Speech surrogacy can serve a variety of purposes, including prayers, proverbial knowledge, and public service announcements such as alerts or warnings.[^2] 
This technological advancement in language and instruments allowed villages to communicate with each other over long distances. 
The phenomenon of speech surrogate drums, aerophones, and chordophones has spawned an interdisciplinary language initiative. 
The tonal characteristics of these languages lead to further specifications for drums being used as well as how many pitches are needed to effectively transfer the message to the instrument. 
For example, Dagbani has many tonal inflections depending on rising or falling vowel pitches; subsequently, the adoption of the Luƞa, an hourglass drum, to linguistically and musically interpret how the practice has evolved. 
West African languages such as Twi (spoken in Asante), Dagbani (spoken in the Northern region of Ghana), and Eve (spoken by the Eʋe in the Volta region) have notable pitch inflections embedded in th allows for a spectrum of pitches that can be manipulated by squeezing the arm while the drum hangs from under the armpit. 
Twi has two linguistic pitch classes while Eve has three. 
The purpose of this essay is to introduce the limited written scholarship currently available on the adoption, history, and practices of the Akan atumpan and the Eʋe atopani.
