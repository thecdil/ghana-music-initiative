## About Ghana Music and Dance Archiving Initiative

The need for a central repository of recordings, photographs, and videos has risen in recent years to secure the messages, traditions, and virtuosity of dancers, musicians, and community leaders from across Ghana. In collaboration with the Agoo-Bi Nii Cultural Arts Center, the Ghana Music and Dance Archiving Initiative is aimed at amplifying individual voices-- giving credit where credit is due and respectfully showcasing their works for students, musicians, and researchers.

[CollectionBuilder](https://github.com/CollectionBuilder/) is an set of open source tools for creating digital collection and exhibit websites that are driven by metadata and powered by modern static web technology.
See [Getting Started Docs](https://collectionbuilder.github.io/docs/introduction.html) for detailed information.
